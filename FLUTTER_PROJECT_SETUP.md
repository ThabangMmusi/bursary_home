# Flutter Project Setup for Bursary Home Application

This document outlines the prerequisites and step-by-step instructions for setting up the Flutter project, integrating Firebase, and configuring asset management for images and icons.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

*   **Flutter SDK**: [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
    *   Verify installation: `flutter doctor`
*   **Firebase CLI**: [Install Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#install_the_firebase_cli)
    *   Verify installation: `firebase --version`
*   **IDE**: Visual Studio Code with Flutter extension or Android Studio with Flutter/Dart plugins.
*   **Node.js and npm**: Required for Firebase CLI.

## 2. Project Creation

1.  **Create a new Flutter project**: Open your terminal in the desired parent directory and run:
    ```bash
    flutter create bursary_home_app
    cd bursary_home_app
    ```

## 3. Firebase Integration

This section covers connecting your Flutter project to a Firebase project.

1.  **Login to Firebase**: In your terminal, run:
    ```bash
    firebase login
    ```
    Follow the prompts to log in with your Google account.

2.  **Install FlutterFire CLI**: If you haven't already, install the FlutterFire CLI globally:
    ```bash
    dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
    ```

3.  **Configure Firebase for your Flutter project**: From your `bursary_home_app` project root, run:
    ```bash
    flutterfire configure
    ```
    *   Select an existing Firebase project or create a new one.
    *   Choose the platforms you want to support (e.g., `android`, `ios`, `web`).
    *   This command will generate `lib/firebase_options.dart` and add necessary Firebase dependencies to `pubspec.yaml`.

4.  **Add Firebase Core and Firestore dependencies**: Ensure `firebase_core` and `cloud_firestore` are in your `pubspec.yaml` under `dependencies`:
    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      flutter:
        sdk: flutter
      firebase_core: ^latest_version
      cloud_firestore: ^latest_version
      # Add other Firebase services as needed, e.g., firebase_auth
      firebase_auth: ^latest_version
    ```
    Run `flutter pub get` after modifying `pubspec.yaml`.

5.  **Initialize Firebase in `main.dart`**: Modify your `lib/main.dart` to initialize Firebase:
    ```dart
    import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
    import 'firebase_options.dart'; // Generated by flutterfire configure

    void main() async {
      WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
      await Firebase.initializeApp(
        options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
      );
      runApp(const MyApp());
    }

    class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
      const MyApp({super.key});

      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return MaterialApp(
          title: 'Bursary Home',
          theme: ThemeData(
            primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
          ),
          home: const Text('Hello World'), // Replace with your initial screen
        );
      }
    }
    ```

## 4. Icon Management (IonIcons)

To use IonIcons in your Flutter project, you can use a package like `flutter_icons` or `ionicons` (if available and maintained).

1.  **Add dependency**: Add the chosen package to your `pubspec.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      flutter:
        sdk: flutter
      # ... other dependencies
      flutter_icons: ^latest_version # Or 'ionicons: ^latest_version'
    ```
    Run `flutter pub get`.

2.  **Usage**: Refer to the package's documentation for specific usage. Typically, it involves importing the package and using its provided icon classes:
    ```dart
    import 'package:flutter_icons/flutter_icons.dart'; // Or 'package:ionicons/ionicons.dart';

    // Example usage in a Widget
    Icon(Ionicons.ios_person)
    Icon(FontAwesome.user)
    ```
    *Note: The original Django project used `ionicons` and `font-awesome` (via `<i>` tags). You'll need to map these to the corresponding icons provided by the Flutter package.* For `fas` (Font Awesome Solid) icons, you might need a separate Font Awesome package if `flutter_icons` doesn't cover them.

## 5. Asset Management (Images)

All static images from your Django project (`static/images/`) will be included as assets in Flutter.

1.  **Create assets directory**: Create a folder named `assets/images` in your Flutter project root:
    ```
    bursary_home_app/
    ├── lib/
    ├── assets/
    │   └── images/
    │       ├── bell.png
    │       ├── books.png
    │       ├── boy white.png
    │       ├── Bursary_Logo.svg
    │       ├── logo.png
    │       ├── school_desk.png
    │       ├── school_student.png
    │       └── students.png
    └── pubspec.yaml
    ```
    Copy all image files from `C:/devs/django/bursary_home/static/images/` into `bursary_home_app/assets/images/`.

2.  **Declare assets in `pubspec.yaml`**: Add the `assets` section to your `pubspec.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    flutter:
      uses-material-design: true
      assets:
        - assets/images/
    ```
    Run `flutter pub get`.

3.  **Usage in Flutter**: 
    *   For `.png`, `.jpg`, etc.:
        ```dart
        Image.asset('assets/images/boy white.png')
        ```
    *   For `.svg` files, you'll need the `flutter_svg` package:
        ```yaml
        dependencies:
          flutter:
            sdk: flutter
          flutter_svg: ^latest_version
        ```
        Run `flutter pub get`.

        Then use:
        ```dart
        import 'package:flutter_svg/flutter_svg.dart';

        SvgPicture.asset('assets/images/Bursary_Logo.svg')
        ```

This setup provides the foundation for building your Flutter application with Firebase integration and proper asset management.
