# Gemini CLI Agent Rules

## New Rule: Verify Step

When a task requires verification, the following process should be followed:

1.  **Research:** Thoroughly research the relevant code, documentation, or external resources.
2.  **Research Report:** Create a `research_report.md` file detailing the findings of the research. This report should include:
    *   Problem statement/area of investigation.
    *   Key findings and relevant information.
    *   Potential solutions or approaches.
    *   Any uncertainties or areas requiring further clarification.
3.  **Verification:** Based on the research, proceed with the verification steps for the task.
