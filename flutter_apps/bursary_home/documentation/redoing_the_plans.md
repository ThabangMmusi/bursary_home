# Redoing the Plans Plan Documentation

## Purpose
This document serves as the documentation for the 'Redoing the Plans' plan. Its purpose is to systematically refactor existing project plans to align with newly established workflow rules, specifically the "Verify Step" and "Documentation" rules.

## Scope
This plan involves:
- Identifying all existing plans.
- Creating or updating `research_report.md` files for each plan.
- Ensuring a corresponding documentation file exists in the `documentation` folder for each plan, with an updated changelog.
- Modifying existing `plan.md` files to explicitly incorporate research and documentation steps.

## Changelog

### 2025-08-11
- **Initial Document Creation:** Created this documentation file based on the research report for the plan.
