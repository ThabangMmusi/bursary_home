# Purpose

This file defines the UI for the login page.

# Functionality

This file displays the login form. It uses the `SignInBloc` to manage the form state and the `AuthBloc` to sign in the user.

# Changelog
*   **2025-08-12:** Removed the logout button from the login page as it was not visible due to the application's navigation flow.
