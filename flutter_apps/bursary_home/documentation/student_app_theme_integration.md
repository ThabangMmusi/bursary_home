# Student App Theme Integration Plan Documentation

## Purpose
This document serves as the documentation for the 'Student App Theme Integration' plan. It addresses the issue of hardcoded colors and direct `AppColors` references in the `student_app`, aiming to integrate it fully with the new theme system (`studentTheme` and `providerTheme`).

## Scope
This plan involves refactoring various files within `student_app/lib` to use `Theme.of(context).colorScheme` properties instead of hardcoded colors or direct `AppColors` references. The affected files include:
- `features/applications/views/applications_page.dart`
- `features/auth/views/login_page.dart`
- `features/dashboard/views/bursaries_page.dart`
- `features/dashboard/views/bursary_details_page.dart`
- `features/dashboard/views/dashboard_page.dart`
- `features/profile/presentation/pages/complete_profile_page.dart`
- `features/profile/presentation/pages/profile_page.dart`

## Changelog
