# Plan: Redoing the Plans

**Date:** 2025-08-11

## 1. Goal

To reset the changelogs of existing plans and establish a clear process for re-evaluating and re-implementing features according to the new development workflow rules.

## 2. Plan Details

### Phase 1: Resetting Changelogs

1.  **Identify All Plans:** List all directories under the `plans` directory.
2.  **For Each Identified Plan:**
    *   Read the `changelog.md` file located within the plan's directory.
    *   Replace the content of `changelog.md` with a standardized initial entry (e.g., "*   **2025-08-11:** Changelog reset as part of redoing plans.").
    *   Update the `progress.md` file within the same plan's directory to indicate that its changelog has been reset.

### Phase 2: Back Plan Initiation Plan

1.  **Create New Plan:** Create a new plan document named `back_plan_initiation_plan.md` under the `plans` directory.
2.  **Outline Re-evaluation Process:** This plan will detail the steps for re-evaluating previously implemented or partially implemented features, including:
    *   Reviewing existing research reports.
    *   Creating new research reports if necessary.
    *   Formulating new, detailed plans adhering to the new workflow rules (phase-by-phase, step-by-step, user approval).
    *   Prioritizing features for re-implementation.

## 3. Verification Strategy

1.  Confirm that all specified `changelog.md` files have been reset to their initial state.
2.  Verify that the `progress.md` files of the affected plans reflect the changelog reset.
3.  Confirm the creation and content of the `back_plan_initiation_plan.md`.
