# Plan: Admin Panel for Manual Company Verification

## Research Report
Refer to `research/admin_panel_verification/report.md` for the initial research and findings that led to this plan.

## Goal

Create an admin panel that allows for the manual verification of bursary providers. This will involve adding a feature to the existing admin panel or creating a new one.

## Steps

1.  **Design the Admin Panel UI:** Design a simple UI that allows an administrator to view a list of bursary providers and mark them as verified or not verified.
2.  **Develop the Admin Panel UI:** Build the UI using Flutter.
3.  **Implement the Backend Logic:** Create the necessary backend logic to store the verification status of each provider.
4.  **Integrate the UI with the Backend:** Connect the UI to the backend to allow for the updating of the verification status.
5.  **Testing & Verification:** Thoroughly test the admin panel to ensure it is working correctly. As part of the "Verify Step" rule, ensure that all verification steps are clearly defined and executed.
6.  **Documentation Updates:** After completing the implementation and verification, update the changelog in `documentation/admin_panel_verification.md` to reflect the changes made.
