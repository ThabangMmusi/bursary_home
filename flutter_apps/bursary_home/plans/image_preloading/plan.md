# Plan: Preload Provider Images

## Goal

Preload the images used in the provider view of the login page to prevent a delay when the user switches from the student view.

## Steps

1.  **Identify images to preload:** List all the images that are used in the provider view.
2.  **Implement image preloading:** Use Flutter's `precacheImage` function to load the images into the image cache when the application starts.
3.  **Verify the implementation:** Test the application to ensure that the images are preloaded correctly and that there is no delay when switching to the provider view.
