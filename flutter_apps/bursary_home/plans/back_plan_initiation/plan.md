# Plan: Back Plan Initiation

**Date:** 2025-08-11

## 1. Goal

To establish a structured process for re-evaluating and re-implementing features, ensuring adherence to the new development workflow rules.

## 2. Plan Details

### Phase 1: Feature Re-evaluation

1.  **Identify Features for Re-evaluation:** Review previously implemented or partially implemented features that require re-evaluation based on the new workflow rules.
2.  **Review Existing Research:** For each identified feature, review any existing `research_report.md` files.
3.  **Conduct New Research (if necessary):** If existing research is insufficient or outdated, conduct new research and create/update `research_report.md`.

### Phase 2: New Plan Formulation

1.  **Formulate Detailed Plans:** For each feature, create a new, detailed plan (`plan.md`, `progress.md`, `changelog.md`) adhering to the new workflow rules:
    *   **Phase-by-Phase:** Break down the feature into logical phases.
    *   **Step-by-Step:** Define clear, actionable steps within each phase.
    *   **User Approval:** Explicitly state that each phase and step requires user approval before coding.
2.  **Prioritize Features:** Based on re-evaluation and new plans, prioritize features for re-implementation.

## 3. Verification Strategy

1.  Confirm the creation of new plans for re-evaluated features.
2.  Verify that new plans adhere to the new workflow rules (phase-by-phase, step-by-step, user approval).
3.  Confirm that research reports are up-to-date for re-evaluated features.
