# Plan: Back Plan Initiation

## Research Report
Refer to `research/back_plan_initiation/report.md` for the initial research and findings that led to this plan.

**Date:** 2025-08-11

## 1. Goal

To establish a structured process for re-evaluating and re-implementing features, ensuring adherence to the new development workflow rules.

## 2. Plan Details

### Phase 1: Feature Re-evaluation

1.  **Identify Features for Re-evaluation:** Review previously implemented or partially implemented features that require re-evaluation based on the new workflow rules.
2.  **Review Existing Research:** For each identified feature, review any existing `research_report.md` files.
3.  **Conduct New Research (if necessary):** If existing research is insufficient or outdated, conduct new research and create/update `research_report.md`.

### Phase 2: New Plan Formulation

1.  **Formulate Detailed Plans:** For each feature, create a new, detailed plan (`plan.md`, `progress.md`, `changelog.md`) adhering to the new workflow rules:
    *   **Phase-by-Phase:** Break down the feature into logical phases.
    *   **Step-by-Step:** Define clear, actionable steps within each phase.
    *   **User Approval:** Explicitly state that each phase and step requires user approval before coding.
    *   **Documentation:** Ensure that corresponding documentation files are created/updated in the `documentation` folder, including changelog entries.
2.  **Prioritize Features:** Based on re-evaluation and new plans, prioritize features for re-implementation.

## 3. Verification Strategy

As part of the "Verify Step" rule, for each re-evaluated feature and new plan:
1.  Confirm the creation of new plans that adhere to the new workflow rules (phase-by-phase, step-by-step, user approval, documentation).
2.  Verify that research reports are up-to-date and comprehensive.
3.  Ensure that all necessary documentation files are created and updated with changelog entries.

## 4. Documentation Updates
After completing the re-evaluation and new plan formulation for a feature, update the changelog in `documentation/back_plan_initiation.md` to reflect the progress and changes made.
