# Research Report for Redoing the Plans

## Problem Statement/Area of Investigation
This report details the necessity and scope of redoing existing plans to align with newly established workflow rules, specifically the "Verify Step" and "Documentation" rules.

## Key Findings and Relevant Information
- **New Workflow Rules:** The introduction of "Verify Step" and "Documentation" rules mandates a more structured approach to plan execution and record-keeping.
- **"Verify Step" Rule:** Requires thorough research, a `research_report.md` detailing findings, and clear verification steps for each task.
- **"Documentation" Rule:** Requires consulting relevant documentation before code changes, maintaining a changelog for modified files, and leveraging existing documentation for context-aware suggestions.
- **Existing Plans:** Current plans lack explicit integration of these new rules, leading to potential inconsistencies and difficulties in tracking progress and changes.

## Potential Solutions or Approaches
- **Systematic Review:** Go through each existing plan and assess its compliance with the new rules.
- **Research Report Creation:** For plans lacking a `research_report.md`, create a placeholder or reconstruct the initial research if possible.
- **Documentation File Creation/Update:** Ensure each plan has a corresponding documentation file in the `documentation` folder, with an updated changelog.
- **Plan Refactoring:** Modify existing `plan.md` files to explicitly incorporate research and documentation steps.

## Uncertainties or Areas Requiring Further Clarification
- The extent to which historical research can be reconstructed for older plans.
- The exact structure and content required for documentation files for plans that do not directly correspond to code files.
