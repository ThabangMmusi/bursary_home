# Research Report: Student App Theme Integration

## Problem Statement

The `student_app` currently uses hardcoded colors and direct references to `AppColors`, which prevents it from fully leveraging the new theme system with `studentTheme` and `providerTheme`.

## Key Findings

The following files in `student_app/lib` contain hardcoded colors or direct `AppColors` references:

*   `features/applications/views/applications_page.dart`
*   `features/auth/views/login_page.dart`
*   `features/dashboard/views/bursaries_page.dart`
*   `features/dashboard/views/bursary_details_page.dart`
*   `features/dashboard/views/dashboard_page.dart`
*   `features/profile/presentation/pages/complete_profile_page.dart`
*   `features/profile/presentation/pages/profile_page.dart`

## Plan

I will refactor each of these files to use `Theme.of(context).colorScheme` properties where appropriate. I will start with `features/applications/views/applications_page.dart`.
