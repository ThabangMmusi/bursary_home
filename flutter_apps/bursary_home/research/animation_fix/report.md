# Research Report: Animation Fix

## Problem Statement

Investigate and identify the root cause of the animation issue reported by the user, specifically the login animation in `auth_layout.dart`.

## Initial Findings

*   **Error Type:** `TypeErrorImpl: Unexpected null value`
*   **Location:** `bursary_home_ui/lib/widgets/auth_layout.dart:44`
*   **Context:** The error occurs within a `LayoutBuilder` widget.
*   **Resolution (Phase 1):** Added `ThemeColors` extension to `providerTheme` in `bursary_home_ui/lib/theme/themes.dart` to resolve `TypeErrorImpl`.

## Current Animation Behavior (After Phase 1 Fixes)

*   The animation now plays without errors.
*   However, the visual outcome is not as expected.

## Desired Animation Behavior (Awaiting User Clarification)

*Awaiting precise details from the user on the current animation behavior and the desired animation behavior.*
